    "The Kaggle [website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) for this data has excellent descriptions of variables in this data so I will not go into great detail about what each variable is.  This data which lists a sample of the ship population could be used to estimate and describe the rest of the ship population.  If I had additional data, I could describe this sample in terms of world or national populations at the time and compare Titanic passengers to the population that stayed on land during the ship's voyage.  Instead I shall take inspiration from the Kaggle competition that tried to predict which passengers survived and which perished and examine which variables correlated with survival the most.  Therefore, the dependent variable which will be studied in detail is 'Survived' which is an integer where a value of 0 means the passenger perished and a value of 1 means the passenger survived.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:  \n",
    "Is the expression \"Women and Children First\" reflected in the rates of survival for these two groups in our data set?  If the lifeboat boarding priority does follow this protocol, then women and children would survive at a higher rate than the other lifeboat boarding group: men.  Is the data consistent with behavior of the men aboard the ship offering lifeboats seats to women and children first?\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the captain go down with the ship?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both questions could be nautical cliches steeped in some sort of romanticism about ship disasters and courageous ways to die at sea.  Investigating whether survival correlated with these expressions should help gain insight to what kind of passengers survived the Titanic disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, are there other variables that could have significantly affected survival rates in the lifeboat boarding groups?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflow stages\n",
    "1. Acquire the data\n",
    "2. Analyze, explore, and identify patterns in the data\n",
    "3. Seperate passengers into boarding groups Women, Children, and Men and compare survival\n",

    "The variable that correlated most positively to survival is 'Female'.  The most negatively correlated was 'Male'.  Clearly 'Sex' correlates well with 'Survival'.  This makes it seem very likely that women were given preferential lifeboat boarding along with female children.  The negative correlation of being male could mean that both men and male children were refused entry on lifeboats.  I can't say for sure at this point whether both female and male children boarded lifeboats at different rate than the adults.  This relationship will be studied in further detail.\n",

    "The variable with the next highest magnitude after those related to gender is 'Pclass' which describes passengers as either 1, 2, or 3.  What this means is that the 'Pclass' is negatively correlated with passenger class.  The higher the number of your class, the less likely you will survive.  This can be confusing because first class passengers are considered upper class and third class, lower class.  Though there does seem to be a strong linear correlation between 'Pclass' and 'Survival', I think a linear correlation is inappropriate for describing what are just three datapoints on the 'Pclass' vs. 'Survival' curve.  The 'Pclass' variable should still be treated as a categorical variable.  Splitting up 'Pclass' into three boolean variables as I have done should make this clearer.\n",

'Pc2' is also positively correlated with survival but to a lesser degree.  The magnitudes of 'Pc3' and 'Pc1' correlations demand further analysis.\n",

    "This histogram suggest that chidren, especially those 5-years and younger, had better rates of survival than most of the sample.  It also suggest that children travelled at a lower rate than adults since there is a discontinuity in the age distribution at around 15 years and younger.  If the sample reflected the general human population, the age of passengers should be gradually decreasing as people age and die.  This age discontinuity is also a threshold where passengers who were younger survived at higher rates than the rest of the sample.  Though this initially suggests that children had a higher survival rate, the age cutoff for children will have to be explicitly definined in order to continue our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram also shows that those for whom 'Age' is NaN are a significant portion of our sample and they also have the lowest likelihood of survival.  Often missing values like this are filled in with a median or mean value from the rest of the sample but this would be reckless if our goal is to seperate adults and children.  A mean or median substitution for 'Age' equal to NaN would group them all as adults.  Alternatively, one could assign a random age to these passengers that reflects the age distribution of the rest of the sample but this could also be misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "I propose examining the sample closely to find some sort of other way of seperating the samples into children and adults.  For now, I will assume that children are 18-years-old or younger."

What it did not do was assign an age to those whose 'Age' is NaN.  I could simply assign the median age of their respective boarding groups to samples whose 'Age' is NaN.  I could also distribute random ages to these samples based on the distribution of ages in their boarding groups.  Both seem like reasonable ways to wrangle the data.  However, 'Age' will not be studied at all in the rest of this analysis so I shall decline to perform this substitution."

Children survived at a higher rate than men.  Being a child seemed to increase survival for males but decrease it for females.  As for the \"Women and Children First\" expression, it seems accurate with women apparently boarding the lifeboats before the children."

    "Supposing that the lifeboats were filled to capacity, it does appear that men took some seats that could have been occupied by women and children.  As it was, 118 women and children died in our sample.  If the men sacriced their seats, only 34 women or children would have perished.  In fact the men could have made the sacrifice which allowed either all the women or all the children to survive in our sample.  It seems as if the \"Women and Children First\" protocol was not followed by the 84 men who survived.  Of course the sample does not really tell us why this happened.\n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This investigation began by addressing two nautical expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Women and Children First\" with regard to lifeboat boarding and\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The Captain goes down with the Ship\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "This was a route to examine what variables correlated with survival in the sample of Titanic passengers.  Passengers were seperated into boarding groups: Women, Children and Men.  It was found that the rates of survival were much higher for Women and Children which could lend some credibility to the \"Women and Children First\" protocol.  During this analysis it was found that gender had a strong correlation with survival with females surviving at higher rates than males as both adults and children.  Overall, women survived at much higher rates than the other boarding groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later passenger class was examined which also had a strong correlation with survival across all boarding groups.  1st Class passengers had a positive correlation with survival and 3rd class passengers a negative correlation.  Women and Children in 1st and 2nd Class seemed to have little trouble boarding lifeboats but their 3rd Class counterparts survived at much lower rates.  Men in 1st class did a little better, but it still appeared that Women and Children got on the lifeboats first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the fare paid was studied and while paying a higher fare correlated positively with survival, it basically just confirmed that being a 1st class passenger as well as being a woman correlated positively with survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "One might conclude that the lifeboat boarding protocol aboard the Titanic was \"Women and Children First, but not if you are in 3rd Class\".  As for the captain of the Titanic, he did indeed \"go down with the ship\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating boarding groups was difficult because many passengers did not have ages listed.  A few assumptions were made and I think the groups came out well.  However, I did fill in any of these null values which could have been useful in a machine learning application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the limits of my statistics knowledge I did not know how to measure statistical significance of categorical data.  This meant that I had to make more general comments about the data and could only state correlations were strong or weak in magnitude.  I was unable to prove any hypothesis using statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wish I was better at using regex functions so that I could extract and more data from the 'Name', 'Cabin', and 'Ticket' variables.  I could for instance create families by matching last names and cabins or ticket numbers.  This could yield more information but I don't feel up to learning how to do this."
